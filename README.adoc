= API Mobile service

This spring boot app exposes a REST API from an API Mobile website (http://${API_INSTANCE}.apimobile.fr/LesMenus)

API mobile is a website available by the food company API.

This is a little project done during slack hours.

It is dedicated to hungry teams who often ask themselves "Should I go eat somewhere else?".

== Configuration

Your API instance is configurable through the VM options or the env variable: `API_INSTANCE` (http://${API_INSTANCE}.apimobile.fr/LesMenus)

== Rest API

* GET `/api/menus`: list menus as string

== Announcers

A scheduled tasked can be configured to announce the day menu.

Configuration example for a TTS (Text To Speech) service and a slack:

```
menu.announcer:
  enabled: true
  cron: 0 0 11 * * 1-5 # announce made from monday to friday at 11am
  webHooks:
    # full configuration example
    - url: http://localhost:8080/hello
      times: 2 # announce repeated 2 times (default is 1)
      sleep: 30000 # sleep time between two announces (default is null)
      writerOptions: [] # options to change the menu output (defaults are [TITLE, DISH_PRICE])
      textAttribute: msg # the attribute name used by your destination endpoint (default is 'text')
      # optional map of attributes
      additionalAttributes:
        volume: 100
        lang: fr
    # slack-like service
    - url: http://slack-like.com/hooks/{hookId}
      writerOptions: [TITLE]
```

[NOTE]
The announcers mechanism only supports the cron attribute, at the moment.
